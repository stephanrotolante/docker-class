Adding Environment Variables to Config


spec:
      containers:
        - name: worker
          image: stephengrider/multi-worker
          env:
            - name: REDIS_HOST
              value: redis-cluster-ip-service
            - name: REDIS_PORT
            value: 6379


so to add environmental variables, you need to make an env property
each property has a name and a value

when getting other containers you can just reference the name of the service

look above we are grabbing the location of the redis service
