Designating a PVC in a Pod Template

This is in the same level as the spec of the container
claimName points to the name of the claim

 spec:
      volumes:
        - name: postgres-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: database-persistent-volume-claim
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432 
          volumeMounts:
          // This name will do to the volumes entry above ans look for the volume with that same name
            - name: postgres-storage
            // This will be where the data will be put inside of the container. The location below is specific for postgres
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
              // This subpath will be the name of the folder housing the mount path
              subPath: postgres
