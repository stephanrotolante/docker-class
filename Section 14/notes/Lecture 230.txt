Creating an Encoded secret

new type of object called a secret -> securely stores a piece of information in the cluster

kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-literal key=value

generic -> this is the type of secret we are creating, there are other kinds
<secret_name> -> this will be the name of the secret
--from-literal -> this means we are creating this config from the command as opposed to a file
key=value -> this is where you set your key value pairs
