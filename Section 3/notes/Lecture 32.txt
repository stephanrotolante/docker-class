The Build Process In Detail

when file gets built it gets fed into the docker client

because we are copying from a base image 
the file system of the base image gets put into the new container

the run instruction get executed ans then the new
programs are put into the file system

after that is all done a snapshot of the container file system is created
and copied


with that new image it gets loaded into a container with the start up command

then that new new image is saved with start up commands and all


now you have a new image
