Service Config Files in Depth

What is a service?

Sets up networking in a Kubernetes Cluster

there are servive sub types such as ClusterIP, NodePort, Load Balanacer, Ingress


NodePort -> exposes a container for the outside world (good for dev purposes)

The node port setups a communicatioln layer between the outside and the container running in the pod

kube-proxy decides what service to route to

the component is the name of the pod that you are connecting to,
web is the label inside of the pod file and the selector in the service file
fyi the property doesnt have to be component, it can be anything else it is just a key value

port -> if there is a another pod in the vm it would use this port number to connect to whaterver this service is for
targetPort -> sends all traffic through (main port)
nodePort -> the port we use in the browser (gets exposed through the outside world)

spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 3050
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 31515 (between 3000- 32767)
  selector:
    component: web
