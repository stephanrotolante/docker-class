kubectl cluster-info - tells you the ip of the kubernetes cluster


Our goal - Get the multi-client image runnign on our local Kubernetes Cluster running as a container


Kuebrnetes 

1) unlike docker-compose, it expects all the images to already be built
2) unlike docker-compose where we have one config file with all the images, Kuberentes has a config file per object (not always a container) that we are using
3) Manualy have to setup network, can't connect contianers by just using the sevice name
