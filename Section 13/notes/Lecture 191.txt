Walking Through the Deployment Config

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: client-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: client
          image: stephanrotolante/multi-client
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000

after the template it is the same configuration for the pds

replicas is the number of pods the deployment is supposed to make

the root selector tells master the label of the pods that are created
