Networking with docker compose


by creating the two services with the same file they will automatically be connected to each other


services: 
    redis-server:
        image: 'redis'
    node-app:
        build: .
        ports:
        - "4001:8081"


because these are created together in the index.js file we can specify the host of the redis server as redis-server, the name of the service
